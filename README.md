This is a python code sheet developed to ease programming with python.
Though it was designed for intermidiate python programmers in mind, but it's not restricted to beginners who understand basis of python.
The code sheet contains over 2,500+ lines of code to help in remembering python syntax, functions, class, modules and other things to know.
Try un-commenting at least ten lines when running.
Double comment on a line depicts important information to read.
Presently working on grouping into modules.
Your contributions is highly welcomed.
